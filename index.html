        <p>I helped to develop since the start with ruby on rails, it was really cool to get this challenge! Doing a plataform for recruitment and selection, where we do match between user and company! Imagine we already have 500k of users... I could apply design patterns concepts, scalable codes, where we could replicate many places.</p>

        <p>It was my first really big project, it was a global catholic event! I helped to develop a kind of ERP, I was really worried with performance... I did table views, set indexes and also developed the Pilgrim Allocation and started to think "Ohh imagine if a pilgrim won't appear and have no place to sleep"</p>

        <p>I was really excited when I discovered javascript animations, being performatic and developing back and client sides in this agency! I could get a lot of standard and perfectionism! I learned SEO, refactors, web semantic and also started to do code stardands and replicate them!</p>
